But do you really need to slather your little one s gums in medicated gels in order to treat their soreness? Turns out, no. The Food and Drug Administration is now warning parents away from certain prescription and over-the-counter teething medications. According to the FDA, the gels and creams parents are using can be harmful to the baby. Specifically, the government agency says drugs like viscous

It was punitive, harsh, stupid, ignorant about pedagogy and motivation, and ultimately a dismal failure. Those who still admire NCLB either helped write it, or were paid to like it, or were profiting from it. It was Bush’s signature issue. He said it would end “the soft bigotry of low expectations.” It didn’t. When he campaigned for t

In the mix of homework, books, music, and of course actually talking, apps can be super helpful when you’re trapped in a car or a plane. Whether you want to listen as a group, have the kids

Figures from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration s Fatality Analysis Reporting System take note of blood alcohol levels of those who die in vehicular accidents, though this data is more often than not left out of the formal cause of death on death certificates. Researchers found that just over three percent of death certificates regi

When people asked me to run against Paul Ryan, it was clear that those folks were looking for some

To the millions of Americans wanting to drop pounds and get healthier, these rigid, eat-this-not-that plans often seem like the hot ticket to a better body. But they usually backfire. Sometimes it s because they are bogus to begin with -- even if doctors at one time backed them. Other times it s because trendy diets get misconstrued, followed for the wrong reasons, or taken too far -- or

In a new study, researchers from the Medical College of Georgia sought to analyze the relationship between high sodium intake and telomere length. Telomeres are the protective caps covering the ends of chromosomes, and they naturally shorten over time as people age. However, harmful lifestyle habits – such as smoking and lack of exercise – can expedite the shortening of telomeres, ultimately speeding up

The researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) discovered that women who can get pregnant naturally and give birth successfully tend to live longer than women who are not as capable of having children. The team reasoned that these women could carry genetic variants that would explain their fertility and longevity. In this study, the researchers analyzed data gathered from the Long Life Family Study (LLF

It applies to societies -- local, regional and global -- and how they view themselves and each other. It also applies to belief systems. But first and foremost it must apply to the individual person, each and every one of us. Without change and dialogue at the individual level, all the other dialogues with others ca
